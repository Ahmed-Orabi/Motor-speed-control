# Motor-speed-control
This is an Arduino project that uses an ultrasonic sensor to control the speed of a motor based on the distance measured by the sensor. If the distance is less than 200 cm, the motor will start moving at 25% of its speed and the lower the distance, the higher the speed of the motor.
